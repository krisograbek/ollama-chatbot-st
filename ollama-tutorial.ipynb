    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with **Ollama**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ollama** is a convenient platform for local development of open-source AI models.\n",
    "Before Ollama, it used to be complicated to run open-source LLMs locally. It used to be very technical and required good understanding of computer hardware and architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Ollama, running local models is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need:\n",
    "1. [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) on you local system.\n",
    "2. Download one of the local models on your computer using Ollama.\n",
    "For example, if I want to use Llama3, I need to open the terminal and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ollama run llama3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's the first time I use the model, Ollama will first download it. Because it has 8B parameters, it'll take a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is downloaded, we can also use it through Ollama API.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Ollama API, run the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install ollama\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And with these steps, you're ready to run the code from this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook, we'll go throught the following topics:\n",
    "- using open-source models with Ollama\n",
    "- the importance of the system prompt\n",
    "- streaming responses with Ollama\n",
    "- the practical applications of the LLMs temperature\n",
    "- the usage and limitations of the max tokens parameter\n",
    "- replicating \"creative\" responses with the seed parameter"
